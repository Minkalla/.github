# Contributing to Minkalla

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Minkalla. It's people like you that make Minkalla such a great community. We welcome any and all contributions, from simple bug reports to new feature implementations.

## Code of Conduct

Minkalla has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under **Issues**.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, **open a new one**. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with the title `[Feature Request] <Your Feature Name>`.
- Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it is needed, and how it would work.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Minkalla? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

- **Good First Issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help Wanted Issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request! Please provide a clear description of the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
